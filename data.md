## Explorations

### Exploratory Data Analysis
I came up with some interesting questions on the dataset and I tried to find answers for the same during EDA process.

#### What age group does the dataset majorly consist of?
I observe that the oldest person in the dataset is 61 years old and the youngest person is 19 years old and the average age as per dataset is 36 years old.
(Found it using visualization)
#### What is the income distribution in different age groups?
Teenagers are higher earners with age group of 25-35 earning 58k-68k.(Found it using visualization)
#### Which age group is spending maximum time on the internet?
Age group of 25-40 is most active on the internet.(Found it using visualization)
#### Data Preprocessing:
Performed feature selection and normalization manually. Then splitted dataset to training and testing sets using train_test_split. 
##### Models used:
Logistic Regression is incredibly easy to implement and very efficient to train.
